Tikka Shack,"Great food and great atmosphere! The chicken tikka masala and garlic naan tasted as if they had come straight from India itself. Because I was so pleased with the entrée I ended 
up ordering the gulab jamun desert and mango lassi beverage and again I was nothing but pleased! Also the employees and management were all very attentive and they made
sure we had everything we needed from beginning to end. The manager Matt personally came around even to check on our experience!",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"I had heard good things about Tikka Shak so I decided to go ahead and give the restaurant a try. The atmosphere was not what I was expecting. Walking through the front door it
felt as if it was a trying way too hard to be modern rather than Indian. The cashier took our orders and was polite, however, when I asked her to make my food mild she must not
have been listening. The food was brought out after waiting for 15 - 20 minutes and it was so spicy I could barely take the flavor of my paneer tikka masala. Overall I was very 
disappointed with my experience.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"I was driving by tikka shack one day and decided to give it a try during my lunch break. I am not very familiar with Indian food and don't have the option too try it as I was born in 
Lubbock. However, I am glad that I did because now I know that it is not for me. The tikka kabobs were way to spicy. I don't know if it were a mistake or all there food is that spicy. 
The sides of the rice dish they gave me were also burned on the edges making it hard to even want to eat. I will not be coming to their establishment again.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"Tikka Shack had the most modern and up-to-date atmosphere of any restaurant period. This was my first time trying Indian food and I was very please with what I got. They did an 
AMAZING job of assimilating Indian and American culture, and the chicken tikka pizza showed just that! I will for sure be returning with friends and family!",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
"India Palace
Indian
Restaurant","Today is the third time I've come to India Palace Indian Restaurant and I have to say that they have consistently great food. The food tastes like it is straight from India. From the 
fluffy garlic naan to their delicious perfect butter chicken.The service was also so friendly and they constantly were checking on us to make sure that we had everything that we 
needed. 5 stars!!!! I will definitely be coming back.",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
"India Palace
Indian
Restaurant","I have been to Royal Indian Palace a couple times but was told to try something else. So I went to India Palace Indian Restaurant to try something new. The servers came to take my order relatively fast and got my food out quickly as well. But the food was decent at best. The bhartiya roti wasn't burnt but was was way to crispy. It felt like I was almost eating a crunchy chip. The food I ordered, which were kabobs, were too salty. The atmosphere was also very cramped looking back. The restaurant was small compared to the others I've been to in Lubbock.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
"India Palace
Indian
Restaurant","Last Saturday I went to this restaurant hoping for a delicious meal at a good Indian restaurant. But me and my family were disappointed. Walking in the restaurant felt like a small and cramped atmosphere. We stayed to give the restaurant a chance and try the food though anyway. However, it turned out my kids didn't even finish their food and my wife and I were disappointed with the biryani dish that we had decided to share. We do not like wasting food but we did not get what we payed for. Stay away from India Palace!",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
"India Palace
Indian
Restaurant","First off, let me say I have never been to the restaurant in person. But from the reviews online I saw that it was not the best dining place. So instead I ordered there food from 
DoorDash. The food arrived but it did not look as appetizing as it looked on the menu. As I had already ordered the food, I decided to give it a try. However, the curry I had ordered 
was not as good as I wanted it to be. The spices were too much and the flavor was off. I'm not very pleased with the food and will be trying a different Indian restaurant in the 
future.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"Royal Indian Cuisine is the best Indian food I have EVER had. All the meat is well cut and halal so you know it's of good quality. The Beef Karahi dish was by far my favorite. Not 
too mild and not too spicy. The rice was also of good quality and cooked PERFECTLY. All in all I am very pleased with my visit to Royal Indian Cuisine. All those positive reviews 
don't lie! BEST INDIAN FOOD EVER!!",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"Royal Indian Cuisine's motto is ""Where Customer is a King"" turned out to not be so accurate. The food from the advertisements of the restaurant were completely different from 
what we were given. My husband and I decided to visit this restaurant for our Friday night out, but were not impressed with the service at all. After receiving the food (which 
wasn't horrible but not good either) we were barely ever checked on after. It's like once they had gotten our money they stopped caring about us as customers. Not pleased and 
will not be returning.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"Coming from India myself I wanted to see if there was food Indian food in Lubbock. The place that was closest to me was Royal Indian cuisine. The restaurant smelled decent and 
they were friendly taking my order. However, I couldn't find anyone to help me after they took my order. I wish they had checked on me more. The shahi paneer that I ordred was 
not too good either. It tasted like it came from a frozen meal. I was hoping since the owners were Indian they would know good Indian food but they did not. I will have to try a
different Indian restaurant in Lubbock.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"My family and I met for lunch at Royal Indian Cuisine on 50th street. This restaurant had the absolute best service that I have ever experienced at any restaurant before. With 
potato pakoda as our appetizer and aloo palak as our main dish, my family and I thoroughly enjoyed our meal. A big thanks from my family to the chef and staff for helping us 
have a great dining experience. We will be returning soon.",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"Good change of pace from burgers, pizza, sandwiches and tacos.Don't expect gourmet Indian food, but it will satisfy your cravings.We ordered Samosas which were really good, 
Tikka masala and butter chicken with rice and naan.All of the food was good and flavorful.Naan was acceptable.I ordered the Indian version of a Chik Fil A sandwich- chicken 
breast dipped in Tikka masala sauce, arugula lettuce, pickles and a creamy sauce.This was a really good sandwich and it was accompanied with fries.A great value.Will 
definitely return when we visit Lubbock.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"First time here, and it was a pretty great experience. The guy in the front taking orders was very helpful. He was very knowledgeable of the menu and was very transparent with his 
answers. We decided to get the Tikka Pizza, Southern Curry Chicken Bowl, and the Spicy Chcicken Kabob. We also ended with the Mango Lassi, Gulab Jamun and the Ras Maiai. The 
Southern Curry Chicken bowl tasted great, but it came out a good 3-5 minutes before anything else so by the time we got the remaining food it was cold. The Tikka Pizza ________. 
The spicy chicken kabob was good, but I wish it came out warmer and it wasn't very spicy. I enjoyed the salad that came with it and the garlic naan bread was amazing. The dessert 
were unique. I can't say we were crazy about the Gulab Jamun but I did enjoy the Rad Maiai.

The atmosphere was open and inviting, and although not advertised (which isn't a bad thing always) they do have WiFi so as a student you can stop by for a quick lunch and do 
some studying as well.

Overall I was impressed. If you are looking for a quick food option that's different then traditional options this is a great place to consider!

Warning: I wouldn't go in expecting authentic Indian cuisine but its good food so give it a try!",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"The second location in Lubbock. Tikka Shack is a fast casual Indian cuisine with self-service similar to the Chipotle concept. In fact, the bowl it uses is very similar to the Chipotle 
bowl. The dining area is spacious with modern open ceiling. There are two private toilet rooms, one for each gender. The ordering process is simple and straightforward. The 
menu selection is adequate, not overwhelming and easy to understand. The older lady that stationed at the front counter seems to be of Indian descent so it should hint at 
authentic Indian cuisine. However, I wasn't impressed with my southern curry entree. It's slightly better than the supermarket frozen microwaveable ethnic meal. The southern 
curry misses the mark - it lacked flavors and depth. I had more enjoyable and better valued meals at Indian buffets I had visited. An example of Americanized Indian restaurant I 
like is Tarka Indian Kitchen - it's fast casual dining without skimping in taste. I have known many ethnic restaurants and many more mediocre ones - the latter often have very 
mediocre chef who wouldn't make it his or her own hometown.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"I don't hate this place, but there are better Indian food places in town. This is like the Taco Bell of Indian food. It is mass produced, not too much spice or complexity of flavor, so non adventurous people can feel they are getting something exotic. If I eat here it is never my choice, but someone else wants to go and I cannot convince them to go somewhere better.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
"India Palace
Indian
Restaurant",I've been coming here for a while now and I want to take the time and share my thoughts about India Palace. The food is always great here but what really stands out is how friendly the owner is. He greets us with such a welcoming cheer. I highly recommend this place for lunch buffet and dinner. The food is always fresh and delicious. Go out and try something different. You won't regret it!,1,1,,,,,,,,,,
"India Palace
Indian
Restaurant",The food was not great. Two of the dishes tasted very sour as there was too much tomato Sauce. Would not recommend this place. I only have two stars cause they kept asking is everything okay.,1,0,,,,,,,,,,
"India Palace
Indian
Restaurant","knew i was in trouble when i walked in the restaurant and there was not the usual aroma of an indian restaurant.This is by far the worst Indian food i have ever had, I am not indian but i have traveled to cities with large Indian populations such as Vancouver BC, LA, and Houston TX. So i have a pretty good idea what the food should taste like. Without sounding downright hateful, this must be what Indian prison food tastes like: it was watery, under seasoned, and made with the cheapest of ingredients. It had no spice which is the hallmark of indian food.and when i asked for chutney to try to spice up the food so it would be somewhat fit to eat, the establishment said: we don't have any but how about a chopped jalapeno pepper?

I am sorry but the 4~ 5 star reviews are hoaxes. I will go as far as to say this: this was the worse food i have had to paid for in the last 10 years.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
"India Palace
Indian
Restaurant","The food is authentic, delicious, healthy, and homemade.The daily buffet is fresh and delicious. There's enough vegan, vegetarian, and meat options for any diet.

The service is fine - it's a small operation so there's not busboys and waiters falling over themselves to help you. You'll be disappointed if you expect an army of people clapping hands and singing idiotic birthday songs. It's the owner and maybe a nice helper.

The restaurant hasn't been updated in a while and looks old. Don't make the mistake another reviewer has made and confuse age with cleanliness. I've looked at the kitchen and it's clean. No, it's not pristine. But you've nothing to worry about.

Go and enjoy yourself!",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"Lunch buffet at a local Indian restaurant. Simple selection of food. Happy.

Rice + Naan + Palak Paneer (Spinach) + a few other things is enough for me.

Located on a street within a street. Parking behind the restaurant.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"A superior option in terms of quality, authenticity, taste and portion size. I highly recommend anyone who is partial toward Indian cuisine try this place out. Really the best option in Lubbock. I've been here many times and gotten the butter chicken, tikka masala and much more. Every time has been delicious. The naan is also very good.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"I do like local restaurants, they're so delicious most of the time but I'm sorry, it was my first and last time! Ive been to many Indian restaurants all over the country but never been this disappointed before! I've almost left everything but the chicken in my plate.

If you really know good meat and you've been to many of good restaurants, you would probably regret going there.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,I was not impressed. The buffet that was promised to be so good was lacking in flavor and spice that is synonymous with Indian cuisine. I feel like they dumbed it down for the local tastebuds instead of staying true to Indian cuisine. Not impressed. Will not be back.,1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"I really love this place. I always try to take new friends with me every time to see if they like the Indian food, and every one has loved it. They offer Excellent service and have a wide selection of dishes. This is the best indian food place in lubbock.",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"Royal Indian is undoubtedly the best Indian restaurant I have ever been to. My wife took me to this restaurant because one of her Indian friends suggested it. However, now I come here every time I want to get some food from outside. The price is also really reasonable and their food is always fresh and full of flavor.",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"This place is the perfect combination of affordability and wonderful taste. When I first went to this restaurant, I was not a big fan of Indian food, due to some unpleasant experience from the last indian food place I visited, but Royal Indian’s food made me fall in love with Indian food and its flavor. I would recommend everyone to go to this place.",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,Nice environment. The air in this place literally aromatic and makes you crave their famous and mouth-watering butter chicken. The staff and the owner is really friendly. I have been coming to this place for a while. I have never been disappointed with their service or quality of food.,0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"Royal Indian serves the most authentic Indian food around the Lubbock area. Although I am not from India, but I know quite a lot about Indian food. Unlike some other so-claimed Indian restaurants around the area do not use fresh Ingredients like these people do. I really like the service and prices as well.",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"I had butter chicken which is my favorite Indian dish and this is now my favorite place to eat it. The sauce had a much more prominent tomato flavor than most other places, which was extremely Pleasant. I'm capable of dealing with some fairly hot stuff but the medium was perfect for me. When I showed up there was hardly anybody in the restaurant oh, and by the time I left every seat was filled, predominantly with Indian people so you know the food is good and authentic. The garlic naan was not just plain naan with a little garlic salt on it , this had tons of garlic and it was wonderful. You know exactly who the clientele is when you see the cricket match playing on the TV. I will definitely have to come back for the buffet.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"Went 12/12/18 with my wife for lunch and had a great experience. The atmosphere was great and the staff extremely friendly. Coming from Houston and having some of the best Indian cuisine that city has to offer, this place holds its own. Of all the places we've been to, my wife enjoys the butter chicken here the most. The vegetarian dishes are to die for and you can taste the authenticity. This is our favorite Indian spot in town and we will return!",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"I ordered the aloo gobi (since I'm all for trying new things) with naan. While I waited for the food to be prepared, I sat and listened to Indian hymns above. The food had already arrived -- with the first bite I was in love. So many flavors that after one bite and two, I just wanted more. The cauliflower and potatoes were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of spices. While living in Lubbock, this is the most I've eaten at Indian restaurants when I was back in Houston, I would rarely eat out, but it's something about Indian restaurants in Lubbock.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"12 place of visiting every restaurant in Lubbock, this place was really amazing especially with a free appetizer i dont know what its called, but it's similar to chips and salsa. My main dish was really good, definitely authentic I would recommend to anyone looking for Indian food in Lubbock.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"I went here and had the samosas (vegetarian) and butter chicken (extra spicy). I really liked the spice level as it was one of the first things I have had in Lubbock with a nice burn to it. The food was very good and the staff was knowledgeable regarding not only the food they serve and customer preferences, but also different types of Indian cuisine served the region and across the state.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,Tikka Shack introduced me to Indian food and I must say I am very impressed with the food they serve here. The location is very clean and well managed. I was well greeted when I stepped in and was immediately helped by a polite cashier. The prices were also very decent. I got my food earlier than I expected and thoroughly enjoyed it. I am definitely coming back in the future.,0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"Tikka Shack is my go to place for getting Indian food. I am not a fan of spicy food, so I did not like Indian food as it is mostly very spicy. However, this place has less spice and more flavor of the food. These guys have successfully modified the Indian dish into a Indian-American style of food. This will let a lot of people who cannot eat spicy food, get a taste of mouth-watering Indian dishes.",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"I really love everything about this place. The place is very neat and clean, the service is wonderful, the prices are really affordable, the portion size is really huge and most importantly, the food tastes really really good. There are no complaints from my side, only good things to say about this place. Everyone must get a taste of their food and I bet that you will love it.",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"For me, Tikka Shack was one of the most horrible food experiences of my life. I know how the Indian food tastes and this was nowhere near that. It was least authentic Indian food I have had in a while in a Indian Food Place.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,I used to like Tikka Shack and their food until one day I found a hair on my food. It would be okay if the other plate they bring did not have a hair in it too. I was really disappointed how the service of this place has been degrading day-by-day and the owner is not willing to do anything about it. I would not go here if I were you.,0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"This place has one of the dirtiest kitchen I have seen in a food place. You can directly see the kitchen from the eating place and I could see some of the employees cooking without the hairnets. I had to wait for like 10 minutes to order some food in an almost empty restaurant. There was literally no one at the register. When the lady came to register, instead of apologizing as most employees in a business would, she was very indifferent and seemed like she did not care.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,The quality of food in this restaurant sucks. I got the chicken butter masala which is my favorite dish at any indian food place but this was something else. It did not even look like the chicken butter masala and surely did not take like one. It had very blunt taste to it and smelled like it had been sitting in the fridge for days. I am not coming here anytime in the future.,0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"Tikka Shack is not as good as some of the people say it is. It says Indian food in the description, but the food is not authentic. The curry has a stale smell and you can tell that none of their ingredients are fresh. They smell like frozen food from walmart. Also the staff are very unresponsive and rude. I would not spend my money here.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"This place may very well be the best Indian restaurant in town. It’s probably the most popular, and both their locations (Milwaukee and by Tech campus) are clean and well-staffed. I eat at one or the other location at least a couple times a week, and it’s excellent every time. If you like spicy food, they have an option to order the food hot (there’s also a third “very hot” option), but if you have a milder palate, they do have a few dishes that aren’t too spicy.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,I go to Tikka Shack all the time. I moved to Lubbock about the time it opened and I have been a loyal customer since. I've enjoyed every dish that I've tried there. My go to is the Chicken Tikka Masala. And the great thing about it is you can have them make your dish spicy if you wish. It's great to have a fast casual Indian restaurant in town. So much better than a buffet. I recommend this place to everyone!,1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"Tastes just like what you'd find in India. We got the tikka wrap and we just couldn't get enough! The sauce they give on the side is to die for and we got more because it was so good. I've never had an indian restaurant around here make fresh paneer and you could taste the difference, it was melt in your mouth. We'll definitely be coming back, can't recommend it enough. If you're nervous about Indian food this is a good place to start. It's very similar to a fast casual restaurant that you'd find in the area.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"Wow! My honest review was removed yesterday. The point of a review is to hear the truth from real customers. Only in a perfect world, all reviews would be great. I'm a CIA graduate. My chicken kabobs were raw in the center more than once. The masala sauce they put on the side was not good in my opinion. The staff were nice. I gave this place a chance not once, no twice but three times. Oh and what's up with the after taste of the lamb kabobs? Do you add kitchen cleaner? I honestly thought I was eating poison. We will not be going back again.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"No complaints about the food or service. BUT: Food runner handled food (Naan bread) with bare hands. The cute little cookie sheets they serve our food on are taken from the shelf above the trash can, merely wiped with a dirty dish rag, then sent right back out with a new piece of paper on it to spread all the germs. Not sure how this is health code compliant.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"The staff was less than friendly, with the exception of one super nice short haired lady who seems like the only one here who gives a rip. She's trying to take care of the entire restaurant cleaning tables, expediting food, and trying to fix all the mistakes. We couldn't find one clean table. The girl who put our order is a total smarta$$. I jokingly commented that their registers were really small. She responded by rolling her eyes with, ""well yeah, they're iPads."" We're still sitting here, and after my friend's dish came out missing half of its components and no sauce, 30 minutes have passed with no fulfillment of such items. Chicken curry is OK. Overall, not impressed. We won't be coming back.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"Don't get a wrap! It took twice as long as the bowls. Everyone in the place was served before me even if they came in way after us. My boyfriend was done eating before I got my food. I ordered a lamb wrap with salad. I got a lamb wrap with RICE (wrong but after the wait didn't say anything) which was really cheese wrap with four tiny pieces of lamb. Hated my experience, won't be back.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"I expected a wait at a new restaurant, but nothing like this. We waited an hour to put our order in. While the line was a moderate size, the wait was due to the fact that they only had one girl working a register. This same girl was also bussing tables and delivering food! The manager and the other girl were standing there seemingly only able to observe. We finally made our way up to the front and the manager asked the girl to have us wait 5 minutes before taking our order. 5 minutes turned to 10 and from what I gathered, they had run out of cooked chicken so they were waiting for more to be done. Ok, fine, but they could have said something instead of leaving us standing there. In the end, the food was not great. I ordered the Chicken 65 shack bowl (""Chicken doused in spiced-up red-hot yogurt sauce, curry leaves, and green chilies"") however, it was not hot at all and lacked much flavor. It came with rice and a cup of Tikka Sauce for dipping which while it didn't taste bad, it had an off putting sweetness to it. The rice was a bit on the dry side as well and I expected more food for $10.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace Restaurant,Indian Palace is the most authentic Indian food restaurant in the area.I went to grab lunch on a beautiful Sunday afternoon and I could not think of being anywhere else than in Indian Palace Restaurant. I loved the food so much that I requested to meet the chef to give him my compliments. They also serve most really rare authentic deserts as well. Definitely worth a visit.,0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace Restaurant,The food here is so good that it reminds of my home. The spices and the aroma of the food takes one to a spiritual food land and makes you crave for more even when you are already full. Never have I ever been so impressed with a restaurant. Their prices are really competitive too. I have wonderful location with adequate sitting space and great food presentation as well.,0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace Restaurant,"I will never ever go to this place in my life. They treated me like I owe them money. They messed up my order and when I told them that it was not something I wanted, they would refuse to take it back. Instead they blamed me for not giving the right order and accused me of one the just wanting free food. The manager took the side of his employee and wasn’t helpful at all.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace Restaurant,"I went there with my family and I will say it is not a place to spend your Sunday evening. The location was very unmanaged and dirty. The food was really disgusting. Everything in the plate smell and tasted like it was made 3 days ago, frozen and heating back up. The curry was a bit cold to be honest. There are better options out there in Lubbock to spend your money.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace Restaurant,"Lot a great place for meat lovers. They have a lot of vegetarian options. All their dishes are highly priced. To be honest, I don't want to spend $15 dollars for a vegetarian dish. I got a chicken Biryani and my wife tried gave a try to a vegetarian dish. I was really disappointed as I could instantly tell that the meat had a really bad smell. My wife also hated her dish and also found hair in her food. They have a lot to improve here.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace Restaurant,"I have nothing good to say about this place. Firstly, the service sucks. I had to wait for almost 25 minutes before I got my food. However, it was not worth waiting for that food. It was really blunt, no spices whatsoever. Also, the prices are quite high. I could easily meat two meals in a decent restaurant with the amount of money I paid for a dish and some desert. This place does not deserve my business.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace Restaurant,"I have been to so many Indian restaurants. Some of them were good, some of them were not. However this was the worst of them all. I love Indian food, but this place is so bad that I was so hesitant going to any other indian restaurant after the visit. The place was so dirty and unmanaged. Really bad service and overpriced menu. I was amazed to see a considerable number of people in the restaurant. This place needs to be empty.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace Restaurant,"We love this place! I give it four stars only because it doesn't look super welcoming outside, and it is quite dated and a little dark inside, much as it would be if you were visiting in India, most likely. But if you can get past appearances and our sometimes over-critical American standards, the food is always hot, consistently prepared and really, really delicious. Even when you're the only customer there, and it seems no one else has been there in years, the food is hot and fresh. Then someone else comes in. Then another picks up a take-out order. After awhile you realize they have a dedicated fan base. Dishes are spotless and I've never had a bad experience. Go during buffet hours and you'll leave stuffed. Be sure to visit with the owner, Paul, too. He is a wonderful host - super polite and helpful. Trust me. Give India Palace and Paul a chance to make your belly happy. You'll be glad you did!",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace Restaurant,"This is my favorite restaurant in Lubbock. The food is tasty and filling. At lunch you've got a cheap, all-you-can-eat buffet with a range of different vegetable dishes, meatballs, chicken, tomato soup, and freshly baked naan. At dinner, it's a bit pricier, but the quality of the food is still excellent and you've got a wide range of choices. I especially like the chicken and spinach dish. I love the decor. It's nothing fancy, but it lets you know you're in an Indian restaurant and puts me at ease whenever I go in there. The best feature of this place is the owner/cook/waiter. He provides excellent service, always appearing at your elbow to refill your water and ask if he can get you anything. He is the most polite individual I have ever met. You feel like you're an honored guest at his home.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace Restaurant,had a horrible experience. had to wait so long. no wonder we were the only customer. the furnitures are from 1925. disgusting decor. Most importantly food is horrible. Samosa not authentic. probably bought frozen. kebab same issue. tandoori is a joke the old Punjabi guy was doing all the job maybe also cooking or rather heating.,1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace Restaurant,"I went to this place yesterday seeing some reviews ,I don't know how they gave such good reviews to this place . I had a doubt about this place when I stepped in as there were no customers ,even though I thought let's give a try and ordered a hyderabadi chicken biriyani ,that guy got the dish ,it didn't look like a biriyani firstly, even though I tasted a spoon ,I couldn't eat more than that. I left the whole dish and called that guy and paid 13 dollars and said that the biriyani is worst ,he replied to me saying that it's a Punjabi biriyani ,it will be like that ,i asked him then why did u name it Hyderabadi chicken biriyani in the menu,he had nothing to say, what he actually did was ,he took some yesterday's butter chicken curry and mixed it with rice, the rice is not even basmati rice , it's Walmart rice. I guess that curry was also spoilt .i am giving 1star because I can't give a zero. Believe me it's a waste of time waste of money ,don't go at all .",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace Restaurant,"Don't be misled by the India Palace title. I tried India Palace outlet in Albuquerque and it was superb. I thought this would be the same outlet, only to find out later it's a rip off. Tried the Lunch buffet. The food was okayish. Slow service. Not worth the price.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace Restaurant,"The owner is very hospitable and hardworking, but I did not enjoy the food. It was weak in spices (meaning flavorful spices- not heat spicy). There wasn't much variety and dishes were very watered down, not saucy. The only thing I liked was the naan and that was impeccable.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace Restaurant,"Worst indian food I have tasted. Had the buffet together with family. Of the about 8 items, 6 were vegetarian and 1 of them was chicken curry and the other was meatball curry(tasted like it was from walmart). There were no fruit trays but there was kheer for desert which wa s mushy. All the items tasted bland and the naan was dry. The reviews for this restaurant were grossly exaggerated and misleading except for the customer service.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,The place is really great. Owner is from my village and is really friendly. He will come and talk you and would suggest the foods.,0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"For me, it was the worst place to have an experience of Indian food. Food was really nasty and the MENU they provide looked to messy and confusing. I didn’t enjoy any moments of being there. I will not go there again. And would tell my friends and family not to visit this place ever in their life.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,It was a nightmare to go there and spend my time. I literally spend my time and money for nothing. People does not know ho to take orders. All the staffs were busy using phones and would talk to you unless you call them. And would respond by looking at their phones. The place,0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"I wonder why such place still exists. Why would people give good reviews about the place? I am still wondering what one thing is at least I could think of the place that was good or may be quite satisfied. God, I want my $20 back",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,The food is very good and a break from the usual daily findings. The chicken biryani was good with a generous portion. The Samosas were also very good. It's great to find inexpensive great food.,1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"Came from out of town. Ordered from here. Chicken biriyanis, very small portions with maybe 2-3 small pieces of chicken. Naan is a pita bread that’s heated up for you. People that hard thing is not Naan!!! Paid $10 for 3 curries. Each curry came with a huge amount of rice on the same plate. So not much curry in each plate. Wasted almost $100 here for nothing. Very disappointed!",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"If you are looking for an authentic Indian food, this is not a place. Ok @ best.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"Just....Meh. We ordered samosas, southern curry, and mango salad. The curry to rice ratio was completely out of proportion. You get mostly rice in your dish. The mango salad was lettuce with half defrosted frozen mango on top. It was inedible and not authentic. Nice place in concept but won’t go back.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian,Royal Indian is really a good place to have a dinner or lunch with your family and friends. I was with my friends and they really loved the place. It was a great experience to spend a quality of time with my friends there. I would love to visit the place again and again in upcoming days and would recommend anyone who want to try best Indian foods.,0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian,"I really loved the food and the services they provide at Royal India. After a long time, I finally got an experience to go and enjoy the foods that gave so much of an Indian taste. I would love to go again and next time I will take my family with me. Also, would love to share my experience in my Facebook or social media so people would get a chance to get a better experience like I did. And I assure that they won’t be disappointed.",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian,I was really attracted by the decorations of the place and the customer service they provide. Workers are really friendly and would give you suggestions of the foods if you are confused to make an order as they have too many to choose from. Manager was really nice and would love to get suggestions from customers.,0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian,"I had butter chicken which is my favorite Indian dish and this is now my favorite place to eat it. The sauce had a much more prominent tomato flavor than most other places, which was extremely Pleasant. I'm capable of dealing with some fairly hot stuff but the medium was perfect for me. When I showed up there was hardly anybody in the restaurant oh, and by the time I left every seat was filled, predominantly with Indian people so you know the food is good and authentic. The garlic naan was not just plain naan with a little garlic salt on it , this had tons of garlic and it was wonderful. You know exactly who the clientele is when you see the cricket match playing on the TV. I will definitely have to come back for the buffet.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian,We go here all the time. It's our favorite Indian place in Lubbock. The food is very flavorful and juicy,1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian,"IF YOU ARE READING THIS... YES, EAT HERE!!",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,One of the best restaurants I have ever been. Food is really great and services are good. Servers are very friendly and would come to check in every 5 minutes. I would love to come back with my friends and my family. They surely likes the place.,0,1,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,This place has given a shame to a pride of a country. I have been to 100s of Indian Restaurants and have encountered some good and some bad restaurants. But this restaurant is out of my mind. I do not even have a word to show my anger through this review. Go yourself and I tell you that you will regret for being there and start hating yourself rest of your life.,0,0,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,"I am ashamed of my friends to give them a treat to this restaurant. I found this place while I searched for Indian Restaurant near me and had a good review. But when I went there, I could not find even 10% of good things that were included in the ratings. I tell you do not risk yourself to go to this place.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,"Thank me later as I am about to save your money. I will tell you, give your money to poor or loose it by getting stupid stuff rather than spending here. Try yourself at home you will make foods better even if it is your first time. I might sue by spending 100s of dollars to get my $25 back. It’s worse than worse than worse.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,Very authentic peaceful atmosphere. Polite patrons and wonderful food at a very modest price. Been in business for many years and always professional. Perfect compliance with health codes.,1,1,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,Very bad experience. Food was really bad I ordered lamb biriyani on door dash. They delivered beef biriyani instead. And rice and flavor was very bad.,1,0,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,"Worst possible food, stinky place, not fresh, high price",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,had a horrible experience. had to wait so long. no wonder we were the only customer. the furnitures are from 1925. disgusting decor. Most importantly food is horrible. Samosa not authentic. probably bought frozen. kebab same issue. tandoori is a joke the old Punjabi guy was doing all the job maybe also cooking or rather heating.,1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,I love Indian food. I’ve traveled all over and tried many restaurants. #tikkashak has great food.. it is order at the counter and table served with very friendly servers. Have visited twice and both time Delicious! #naannation,1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"Amazing food and the owners are so sweet. Great family atmosphere, amazing food and the staff are so friendly. Highly recommend the butter masala and shack naan. Amazing comfort food I with a kick. ❤️",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"I am a really picky eater and I love this place! Just me, that means a lot. The curry with some garlic naan is what I crave most days. I come twice a week just about. The atmosphere is very modern and accommodating and I’ve never not seen a warm smile on a staff member! Best part: there are more than one vegan option!! That’s huge for me and a competitive advantage for the restaurant!",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"My wife and I eat here like twice a week. We love it. The food is consistently good, and the people who work here are great. Service is fast and friendly. Prices are awesome for how good the food is. My only gripe is that there is always a TON of rice in the tikka masala dish and not enough sauce. I end up scraping half of the rice out first thing after I get my food",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"The prices are a food is cheaper for most meals, and the service is consistently pleasant and attentive. The chief advantage of this restraurant is its amazing meals. I would choose Tikka and also Tikka's buffet is superior.",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"I usually go for buffet.The food was excellent. Very flavorful and tasted ""fresh"". I only eat vegetarian but my friend eats meat and he thought the meat dishes were excellent as well as the vegetarian. The staff was the most friendly of any Indian restaurant I have been to - anywhere. The prices are competitive and I am looking forward to going back ASAP! Highly recommend! I've been to Royal about 10 times by now. And every time it's been consistently good.It is probably the only place that  I can consistently agree on. It's VERY vegetarian friendly. And the buffet is always SO GOOD! It's never been the same main entrees every time I go there.",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,I'm a loyal fan of this place. The food here is definitely a notch above some of the Indian restaurants in the area and they are priced relatively well.Good buffet and prices are pretty reasonable. Service was first rate and while not high end a very pleasant and neat interior apperance - better than the strip mall would suggest.,0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,It's my fav and they make it pretty well. They go easy on spice even though I ask for hot every time. Once in awhile they get spice right. The price of food is reasonable and the place looks pretty good.It's not that busy in weekdays so you always find peace.,0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian,"I found Royal Indian Cuisine shortly after moving back to Lubbock. I ate here for the lunch buffet twice before my husband arrived.When my husband got to Lubbock, we ate dinner here his first night in town and then the next day we came back for the lunch buffet. The food is as good as the best Indian I have eaten. The flavors are subtle. The heat of the spices is just right. We ordered medium off the menu and it was mildly spicy. Next time we will take it up a notch. The service is friendly without being obtrusive. This is our favorite restaurant in Lubbock.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian,We have had dinner there several times and the food has been awesome. Tried the buffet yesterday for lunch and loved it....food was hot and the naan was the best ever. Just wish I could do a buffet justice,1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian,"I came here with my friend and loved it. The service was great and the food was wonderful. The chicken tikka marsala and chicken biryani are always my go to dishes when I try a new Indian restaurant, I was definitely not disappointing. Everything I tried were very flavorful and even though it was a buffet the food was hot. I will definitely be back!",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian,"Excellent food and good people very family friendly environment if a bit long on the wait for food. The food was delicious and well made and I would eat there again
",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian,This restraurant have some issues. The food came out looking nothing like the pictures. I don't recommed anyone to go to this restraurant. I get sick each time I eat at this place.,0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian,"To be honest, the open concept of this restraurant really makes noisy dining adventure. The food is really expensive then it supposed to be.I came in here about a week ago and I was really disappointed. I spent $50 on food and tip for my to-go order and we only got 3 items. The worst part is that I called ahead and they said my food would be ready in 15 minutes and when we got there we had to wait 45 minutes.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian,Food was not bad but I was disappointed at the fact that we put no celery and sprouts and they put them in all of our fried rices! What if we had an allergy to them? What if we waited 1 hour for our food and couldn't even eat it due to this!,0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian,"Waiting 45 minutes for a tiny box of fried rice and 4 dumplings that looked like they came from the supermarket. It wasn't even busy. Price was 18 dollars. Maybe it was 20. I just don't feel like there is anything special. Good, but not WOW.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,"I just had the most incredible Murgh tikke mahkani (sp?) plus vegetable samosas. The owner is the nicest man, and prepared the dish perfectly. I don’t live in Lubbock anymore, but I always stop by for a meal anytime I’m in town. Best place in west Texas for Indian food.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,"We went to this restaurant on a Wednesday night around 7 PM. There was no customers and we had to holler to get the staff's attention. The first table we sat at was dirty, so we moved a different table. It too was dirty. We asked the waiter to clean it, which he did. When he brought the utensils, we noticed that they were also dirty as well as the sugar container. At that point, we left the restaurant without ordering any food. It was a shame that the owners would allow their restaurant to be in such a terrible state.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,Ordered Chicken biryani and chilly chicken. Absolutely enjoyed the taste and quality of the food. Chilly chicken was way too spicy even though I said medium level spicy. Worth the place to have Indian food. Shall try the buffet soon after I am back to city.,1,1,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,"My family and I began dining with Mr. Pal circa 1998 and were impressed with his genuine kindness and attentive manners. The atmosphere is definitely not West Texas nor fancy. The interior decor reflects many of the Indian traditions and culture. Parking is convenient. Everyone is greeted promptly and made comfortable. Our children learned about Indian food and appreciated Mr. Pal's gracious instruction. I loved the various types of nan and lamb dishes, which we always ordered extra spicy. I highly recommend India Palace and wish we had as good a Indian restaurant in our area!",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,"Samosa was not tasty at all. It was very plain and flat. It lacked main ingredients and spices which made it gross. And employee  seemed very busy, but I said hi and told her 2 for dinner please so she stopped what she was doing and sat us. The food is ok. I felt it lacked the spices and flavor that I love in restaurant Indian food. On another note, the restaurant was packed so not everyone agrees with my opinion.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,"I'm not sure if the food would be categorized as Indian food. Fish amritsari was horrible.Bones, bones, bones in the chicken. Not a fan of the flavor for the price. Also VERY thick Naan, which is the first I've ever had like that. Not returning.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,"The restroom of this restraurant is dirty. It looks like they haven't clean this for a year. The lighting is dim, the decor subdued, and restaurant mostly quiet. Food is a bit pricey. Don't get the lamb phall. It's not just a spicy curry - it's over spiced with no salt. Rice was ok. Naan was too doughy (undercooked). Kinda disappointed",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,Food was very disappointing and even customer service very bad. I hate the attitude of waiter who work here. I Tried quite a bit in the menu and nothing stands out aside from the dhal ghost that was ordered hot and came witout a hint of chilli.,0,0,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,"The most inauthentic Indian food Iv tried so far in US. It was sweet like a dessert and creamy like a mocha. If you ask me how authentic was the flavour, it was very very inauthentic. Maybe 1 out of 10. I ordered butter Chicken. The Chicken itself was broken into bird size pieces in a pool of sweet inauthentic gravy.The closest taste I can describe of the butter chicken, it tasted like Kheer which is Indian milk rice dessert. I got two of them, I ended up giving the other one away to someone on the streets.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"My husband and I discovered Tikka Shack a couple of weeks ago when we just happened to be in the area. Sadly, that is not a regular occurrence, because honestly, this is some of the BEST Indian food I've ever had!

Tikka masala is my favorite, but my husband ordered it, so I order the Southern Curry to try something different. Both were SPECTACULAR, but I just keep coming back to my tikka masala... We had 3 heat options: none, medium, and hot. My husband -- who LOVES his hot peppers -- asked for hot. The young woman taking our order asked ""Are you sure? It's really hot!"" We both assured her he was sure. It was HOT! And he loved it! (I got medium, which a had a really nice kick; if you prefer just a hint of heat, go for none.) We also tried the samosas, which honestly may be the best I've EVER had. And the naan...... [insert eye-roll emoji].... We ordered 2 orders to bring back home, and I wish we'd ordered 10!!!

We also loved the atmosphere. It's very casual, of course, but lots of natural light, surfaces made of -- or made to look like -- natural materials, and the very creative decor (funky light fixtures, a table made out of a bicycle, great murals) give it a very warm, welcoming feel.

Finally, the service was fabulous. You don't often think about the service at a counter-order place, right? You will here, because you'll notice that it IS  a thing, even at counter-order place! Extremely welcoming, friendly, and helpful. As we were leaving, the owner even came out to ask us about our experience and was so very gracious.

Like I said, we just happened to be passing through, but next time we're anywhere remotely nearby, we will definitely detour to Tikka Shack!",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"My family and I have never dined here before. My daughter had heard the food was good.
When we got inside there wasn't any employees visible. We were just standing there when I saw two people come out of the kitchen, look right at me and went right back into the kitchen.
We sat down, more people came in and sat as well. Finally a lady came out with 4 bottled waters. We didn't ask for them but I thought that was nice.
A guy came out and took our order, then dealt with the other two tables. 10 minutes later the other two tables got their food. 15 minutes later we got ours. My wife ordered a Coke, but that didn't come, as well as no plates, napkins, utensils. After he spent additional time with the other tables we had to wave him down to get the missing items, including a warm can of Coke.
The food was ok. My wife and family  ordered butter chicken, I had a dish I can't remember. It had eggplant and potatoes. The naan bread was pretty good.
So before we left my wife went to use the restroom. She described it as disgusting. Photographs are attached.
So we get the bill, and I noticed there were charges for 4 cokes and 1 Diet Coke. So I ask tell the guy we didn't order 4 additional sodas. He says those are for the bottled water(which we didn't ask for).
So, quick tips, if you eat here, I'd take it to go. Order drinks? Ask for refrigerated sodas and don't use the bathroom.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,Excellent customer service and food. The channa masala and samosas were too good to be true. Definitely try out their lamb biriyani. Absolutely loved the experience.,0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,Too bad an experience! Naan was too hard and the dough had not risen enough. Ckicken was very dry. Food was waaaay too spicy and salty. It was a very disappointing evening for me and my boyfriend. Will never visit again.,0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,Amazing food and ambience. Chicken tikka was so buttery and I would definitely reccomend garlic naan to go with it. Would definitely visit another time,0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace,"Dropped by here for an early dinner before an event at Oakland Arena. We started off with the veggie samosas, and split the vegetable biryani and vegetarian sabzi. Everything was delightful. The samosas were a generous size and piping hot. The chutneys - spicy green and sweet tamarind - were delicious. I loved the biryani, the rice was fluffy and the curry, spiced vegetables and cashews were so good. The sabzi had chunks of potatoes, cauliflower, onions and peppers. And of course our garlic naan, an absolute must! 

Patio is very cute, our server was attentive and friendly, and the place is very clean. A solid choice for Indian fare.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,Disgusting. Had a long day on the road and we thought this would be a satisfying meal. We ordered the vindaloo Witt extra chicken and it had maybe an ounce of inedible shredded dark meat and a greasy sauce with undercooked veggies. Repulsive.,1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"The first time I went to this place I was certain I was in India. I saw a small man wearing a traditional garb and leather sandals come outta the kitchen holding a pan of naan bread. I knew something legit was possibly about to be presented to me. Legit it was. The food is straight fire! Super yummy, homemade and unique. Here's the bad..its expensive. Like for two people it was around 37 bucks with a tip. But hey whatever lambs are pricey and naan is good. Oh also last winter the place was heated by a series of space heaters..it was hella cold. Hopefully thats been fixed considering how much that naan be costing lolz.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace,"I came to visit this restaurant with some friends after attending a concert, and was so disappointed about the quality of the food here. The waiter was not friendly towards guests. We were shocked at the service that we were getting for the high prices on the menu. I would suggest to others to find a different restaurant nearby to receive a more heart-warming welcome as well as excellent food choices.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"I can't believe I have not found out about Tikka Shack until today! This place offers a great variety of Indian dishes that anyone from children to adults will enjoy. I especially like their curry! Overall, the prices were affordable along with great service from the staff. I recommend you to come by when you are in the area!",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"Coming to this restaurant today, I expected to have an authentic experience but it turned out to be terrible. I am especially turned off by the substandard in cleanliness and staff professionalism. The food was not as spectacular as I believed them to be. I hope that this place will do a re-examination to up their game in bringing the authentic Indian food to everyone who decides to visit in the future.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"Pretty good food, not really spicy at all, but maybe I missed something on the menu where I could request more spice? 
Naan, not really great. Samosas pretty good. Overall decent fast food version of Indian, but definitely prefer something more authentic.
Nice patio 

Edit: I look forward to trying again! Thanks for the information.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"I've been here a couple times now, and I'm definitely a fan. If you are craving Indian food, this spot is definitely worth checking out.

Both times I've come here, I've ordered the Butter Chicken. I like the butter chicken over the chicken tikka masala because of the use of the dark meat. The sauce has such deep flavor, it literally goes good on everything! It comes in a small container, but don't be fooled, there's a lot in there, and well worth the price. You can adjust the spice level, I ordered spicy and extra spicy, honestly couldn't tell the difference. Still very good though.

Being that I love rice, I ordered biryani both times (chicken the 1st visit, lamb the 2nd). Between the two the lamb biryani was more my vibe. The lamb was tender and had a lot of flavor. It's a big enough portion to share with a few people, but since I was solo I turned it into a couple of meals on top of the butter chicken and naan.

For the naan, I tried the garlic and the chicken naan. Definitely preferred the garlic one. I thought it had more flavor and it was a perfect vessel to dip on the butter chicken.

The one thing I wasn't a big fan of was the lamb vindaloo. It didn't have much depth of flavor but I also think I just loved the butter chicken so much that it overshadowed everything else.

If you go on their website, you can order online for delivery or pickup. I like the option because it allows me to choose spice levels. Super easy to use, and the food was ready in under 20 minutes. Definitely a go-to whenever I'm in the area and craving Indian food.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,"The food was great. I’ll admit. Cannot say anything even close to that about service. The manager (the lady who served us), was straight up rude.
She was clearly trying to get us out of the place as fast as possible. We were one of the three tables at an otherwise empty restaurant.
When asked for additional bread, she straight up glared at us in silence for a minute, before quietly nodding her head. When we asked to see the menu again for dessert, she refused to give it and lied to our faces listing two desserts. When I asked if a third item was available, she denied when I had, a minute ago, heard the next table ordering it.
When we tried to compliment the food, she was very snarky and unwelcoming.
We were well dressed, paid for our food and even tipped well. This was entirely unwarranted and completely ruined what would have been a very nice experience.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"Clean, modern, appealing restaurant. Pleasing atmosphere. However, the food didn't taste the greatest. The Southern curry didn't have any vegetables or mustard seeds as stated on the menu. It was too salty. I certainly did not feel that it was a good value for the price.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"I ordered dinner expecting decent Indian food.

India Palace,"Great food, great service.. One of my all time favorites!",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"Great quick bite. Not cheap, but what is now a days? The Somosa were crispy, a bit bland, but the pesto sauce was excellent. And the coconut shrimp taco was a good idea, but 3 shrimps on a Nan bread is not a taco just ate like a taco. Still I'd recommend it for the taste.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"Love, love, love! Hands down the best Indian food I've ever had. Great people and good portions . Nothing heats or keeps as well as Indian leftovers. They got us through the pandemic and many a smoky (no cooking) day. Can't sing their praises enough.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,"BEST INDIAN FOOD EVER! I absolutely love Indian cuisine and have tried Indian restaurants in both the USA and Europe. India Palace is hands-down one of the best places to go if you're looking for authentic, tasty, and absolutely delicious Indian Food.

Tikka Shack,"Paneer butter masala was alright. Was bland. Naan, I have never had such naan. Maybe was frozen and heated up. Resembled I think kulche. Don't know. Paneer biryani smelled bad, the rice was well just rice, either uncooked or dried up because of sitting too long. It wasn't really biryani. Was like uncooked rice haphazardly mixed with paneer curry of some sorts. I get the whole shack and grub concept but wouldn't that be more fresh ingredients, freshly prepared and not frozen, simple but authentic. The food was neither, I must be confused about what's shack and grub.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"I love Indian food.   For me this is the best Indian restaurant in town.   In the past the food was very good, but recently they eliminated the all you can eat $9.95 buffet.   Maybe they have changed owners?   Anyway the food as gone from very good to outstanding!   While I miss the $9.95 all you can eat deal I'm happy to pay a little more for the superior food.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,I used really like this place but I won't be returning. Everything tasted watered down and bland even when we asked for spicy food. I couldn't even finish my meal. Both my husband and I immediately felt sick after eating.,1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"It’s a lovely ambiance for two at dinner time especially. We ordered three dishes… the Korma masala, the Veggie Jalfrezi and Chicken 65 with a side of Basmati rice. The service is excellent. The staff are super courteous but not well informed of the dishes. I found the quantity a tad bit less never the less the overall experience is good.",0,1,,,,,,,,,,

India Palace,"Finally gave this place a try after many months of planning! Our table incharge, Nikunj, suggested some of their dishes that were a pleasant surprise and absolutely delicious! Loved everything that we ordered from the drinks to the Papadums to the main course and the dessert. This meal was definitely one of the best Asian food I have ever had. Also, Nikunj took great care of us right from when we were seated till we left the place.",0,1,,,,,,,,,,

India Palace,"Amazing food, and really nice outdoor seating area. The first time we went, my husband and I got the chana masala, lamb biryani, garlic naan and samosas for an appetizer.

We'll need to go back again and try other items on the menu eventually.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,

Tikka Shack,"It's never fun to write a negative review of a place, but I just wasn't impressed. I understand perhaps toning the capsaicin down a bit so you don't burn people's mouths, but toning down on all of the other spices and flavors I don't really get. If I went back, I'd probably try their namesake chicken tikka masala, but I probably won't bother.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"Clean, quiet and efficient, not a bad place to grab a quick lunch or dinner if you are in the area!",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"Didn't have high expectations as I would normally eat at an actual Indian restaurant. We got the Lamb Goan Vindaloo and Butter Chicken Masala and they were both very good and flavorful. Much more than I was expecting! That's about where it ends. The rice was bland and not even lukewarm and the garlic naan had almost no flavor. I feel like I would get more garlic flavor from someone's breath because it was basically just a piece of bread we had to pay $1.50 for. Unfortunately, I feel like everything costs too much for what you get

That being said, the staff were also nice and cordial. All in all, we certainly didn't hate anything and we wouldn't hesitate going back again",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
India Palace,I got samosas and the murg murch masala. Everything was great and the man was very nice. He is the only one running the place so it took some time but it was well worth the wait! The samosas were some of the best I've had and I will definitely be back!,1,1,,,,,,,,,,

Royal Indian Cuisine,"We had a great time. Nice interior and conveniently located. We ordered assorted breads (garlic, onion and butter naan), daal chicken and vegetable biryani. All of the food was good and was served extremely quickly (we were one of only two people in the restaurant around 5:00. Nice place!",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,It was a complete waste of time and money. The interiors looked old and the location is not easy to access.

Tikka Shack,"VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!  I have been to this restaurant in the past, and it has gone downhill.  I ordered the Tikki Wrap, which is vegetarian.  THEY PUT CHICKEN IN IT BUT IT WAS VEGETARIAN!!!  And it wasn't even good. The kid who waited on me kept playing with his hair and acting very disinterested.  The whole staff spent more time and interest in socializing than in waiting on customers.  They need to retrain all of their staff and tell them not to play with their hair around food, to pay attention to the orders rather than socializing with each other.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cusine,"It really doesn't look like much from outside, but we ordered to take out and were blown away. Everything was delicious, really generous portions, I am really picky about my dishes and they did an amazing job. the owners are very friendly.

India Palace Restaurant ,"The location may be off-putting, but the food is delicious. This is still our favorite place for Indian food. Vegan and vegetarian options are available, the curries range from mild (which is plenty spicy for me ) to hot, and the naan options are delightful! My husband loves lamb and is pleased with the variety of different dishes, while I lean towards the seafood and veggies. The ambiance isn't much but we have always had good service. We haven't tried take out yet, but they advise ordering an hour and a half ahead, at least.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,

Royal Indian Cusine,I ordered from this place and the food was horrible. Probably the worst Indian food I've had. The paneer seemed watered down and the naan was undercooked. I had to stop eating in the middle to write this review it was that bad. The reviews were good so I decided to order but never ordering again. Honestly even the Amy's frozen Indian food (which is a really low bar) is even better than this. Really disappointed,1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cusine,"Excellent lunch buffet; the chicken curry is one of the greatest I've ever eaten in this area. The greatest buffet lunch is on weekdays. You can also order from menu. Great selection of vegetarian food too. On the side table, there was also salad. ",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"I'm so satisfied. I ordered delivery and was pleasantly surprised. The flavors were spot on. I asked for x-hot. It didnt make me cry but was delicious. The rice was great. I ordered the malai kafta. I'm not a vegetarian, but it is one of my favorite dishes anywhere. Looking forward to my next order.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"The space is too small, and the floors are frequently slick. The flavor of the standard buffet foods was decent, aside from the ambience. Most of their business happens through the delivery apps. It can an be improved by the main meal and the appetizers.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,

India Palace Restaurant ,Authentic Indian food. Have been enjoying their food with no complaints. The quantity of the food items is more than most of the similar restaurants. Servants were kind and efficient. Excellent meal and customer service!,0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,I am in love. We tried several different dishes to see how they were and we loved it all. The curries were all flavorful and the heat level adjustable. Everything was very fresh and made to order. The only thing I will change next time (because there will be a next time) is since I'm a spicy addict I will get the extra hot.,1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"Tonight was my first time that use this restaurant, and all I can say is that the staff was rude and uninterested in their duties. The food was also awful. The ""sweets"" were not authentic; they actually tasted synthetic. Would never recommend this place.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,

Royal Indian Cusine,"Like the names states, it is great Indian cuisine. For a fairly small venue, this restaurant can seat larger parties, but get here as soon as you can before the crowds come. The food here is so delicious!

I appreciate the fact that this one stays away from the heat factor all too prevalent in many Indian restaurants, especially in their buffet offerings. The flavor is definitely there, but the heat does not get in the way. If you are the type who can't take the chili hotness in Indian food, you will definitely want to try  out this place! And at only $15.99 for a buffet, this is east on your wallet!

With so many Indian restaurants closing around Santa Clara/San Jose during the pandemic, it is nice to see some smaller ones like Great Indian Cuisine stick it out and truly shine!",1,1,,,,,,,,,,

Tikka Shack,"Although the restaurant has a tempting menu and located in a prime area, food is below average. The basic flavors and Indian spices are missing.

You can try many other good places rather than wasting your money here.",0,0,,,,,,,,,,

Indian Palace Restaurant,"Ordered Mumbai sandwich, veg puff and a rose tres.
Taste- The dessert was the best, but the other 2 were just novelty items- you don't find them often.
The portions though are really small and didn't feel worth the money. A 9$ sandwich better taste real good or fill me up at least.",0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cusine,"I'm glad to have a local Indian place. Their naan is solid and most often I'll have a chicken vindaloo which is great. My partner is vegetarian and has been happy wit some of their dishes, but less so with others. Some are actually too creamy. They also are pretty slow. It's fine if you're eating in, but almost every time I get take out, they give me an estimate of the time it'll take and it ends up taking 10 minutes extra. Also when I arrive often no one is there to greet you or take your payment, and they have trouble finding your order. So don't go there for speedy service.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"I'm hoping it's just opening issues since they are pretty new. The samosa was almost ""wet"" like the oil wasn't up to temp when they cooked it so it absorbed oil. The outside crust wasn't quite as crispy as it should be either.The chicken 65 was another disappointment. It too had an oily residue in the bottom of the dish and was about 1/2 the size you get at other places. It's almost like they didn't do the pan flash with seasonings right before serving. This step would likely remove the wetness and add some more flavor.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace Restaurant,"Excellent! A neighborhood staple in the same building with the Travelodge of Sausalito-Mill Valley. Food was really great, my meal was well coursed out and all dishes were very well presented. I regularly order their Garlic Naan bread to accompany their Saag Paneer curry, but decided to try their creamy Tikka Masala curry this time with a few appetizers and it was all delicious! The Mango Lassi fruit yogurt beverage was also amazing and not overly sweetened! Thank you for the warm hospitality, looking forward to my next visit!",1,1,,,,,,,,,,

Tikka Shack,WORST INDIAN FOOD EVER ! I hope there is negative star I would have picked up that. It’s one of the worst Indian food I have eaten with Panner was like rock solid and it was not even Tandoori. The Garlic Naan was bad with adding crushed garlic on pita bread and the curry was so sweet. It’s not even close to Indian food. GO TO EVEN TRY HERE !,1,0,,,,,,,,,,

Royal Indian Cuisine,"I would not recommend this restaurant. The palak paneer I ordered was brown. The chana masala was bland, and my husband's main course was incredibly watery.

Royal Indian Cuisine,PERFECT BLEND OF INDIAN SPICES! If you want to experience real Indian taste you have to try this place! I cannot even emphasize how tasty the food was let alone their desserts. I tried the Gulab Jamun and it made me feel like I was eating in India.,0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,"If you like garlic cheese naan bread then you are looking in the right spot. Tikka Shack has delicious naan and curry. I would not say it is better than authentic Indian, but I would say it satisfies the craving each time I go. Which is pretty often because their food is fresh and made with love.",1,1,,,,,,,,,,

Tikka Shack,"I wanted to like Tikka Shack after hearing the hype, but it was very mediocre. We ordered the chicken tikka masala. The chicken was cooked ok, but it was slightly tough. The sauce was also just ok. The real problem was the rice. I'm pretty sure they ran out of basmati rice and instead just threw in regular white rice. The rice was also poorly cooked and stuck in chunks together. It was a huge disappointment. There was also absolutely no garlic on our garlic naan. Overall, just a disappointing experience.",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,I recently visited tikka shack a couple of days ago. I went with my usual order for indian food which was garlic naan and butter chiecken.

Indian Palace Restaurant,"It's all about the food-and the care shown to you. Mr. Pal is a most gracious Host & the food never disappoints. The restaurant is a very modest strip center location but the price for M-F buffet is only $6.99! Don't be intimidated because you don't know what all the food is called. Try a little of everything and go back to the buffet for what you like best.
C'mon, Lubbock! Break out and enjoy great flavors!",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace Restaurant,"I usually visit this place ver frequently. The ambience was good and waiting time was less when I visited earlier. But recently, the wait time is beyond 50 mins.

Royal Indian Cuisine,"Although I haven't sampled the buffet yet, I've had the chance to order something vegetarian off the menu and I wasn't disappointed.

The setting of the restaurant is nice and clean, the wait staff is accommodating and explains the meals to the tee. They are sweet people.

I ordered the aloo gobi (since I'm all for trying new things) with naan. While I waited for the food to be prepared, I sat and listened to Indian hymns above.

The food had already arrived -- with the first bite I was in love. So many flavors that after one bite and two, I just wanted more. The cauliflower and potatoes were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of spices.

While living in Lubbock, this is the most I've eaten at Indian restaurants when I was back in Houston, I would rarely eat out, but it's something about Indian restaurants in Lubbock -- they are so close and it doesn't take much to travel to them hence no traffic!!!

I didn't care for the naan -- it didn't taste fresh. It had more of a chewy tough bite to it that it gave my teeth an extreme exercise to devour.

The prices are affordable and I can't wait to go back!!",1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"If you want to try very good indian food, you must visit this place. I started off with a light soup and ordered chicken Manchurian for the appetizer.

Tikka Shack,"Chicken kabobs was raw. I'm so angry right now. I couldn't eat it. They forgot my naan that I paid for, Also the chicken tikka masala was so spicy. I called them and asked please not to make it spicy. I paid almost $50 for all of the food that I ordered. It was a wast of my money. Not going to order from this place ever. Not recommended!!!!!",1,0,,,,,,,,,,
Tikka Shack,I usually don't eat outside very often and Tikka Shak is the only place I prefer if I want to. The flavor is always consistent as is the tenderness and quality of the items. I'm not very crazy about the Seafood but everything else is really tasty here. A must go place!!,0,1,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace Restaurant,The outside of this restaurant in this little shopping center is not indicative of the glory found within.  The lunch buffet is outstanding and the Indian is delicious and maybe the best I've had.. period.  I've travelled the world. Mr. Ball is a one man show and has been making these dishes for me for over 30 years.  He's the kindest person in the world and the food is just bar none:  I highly recommend this place for those who truly know and love Indian you will not be disappointed!,1,1,,,,,,,,,,
Indian Palace Restaurant,The food served at this place was at best mediocre. I ordered Paneer Makhanwala and the gravy was too oily. The taste of oil ruined the entire dish. The naan we ordered were soggy as well. The overall food quality provided here were below par when compared to other Indian restaurants I've been to. The prices were too expensive and not reflective of the quality of food and service provided here ,0,0,,,,,,,,,,
Royal Indian Cuisine,"Their food was worth the wait. Though it took a while to prepare the flavors in their tiki masala,butter chicken, bullet Naan, lamb Kadai and onion kulcha was fantastic.
